# Bluesky Theme

This is the theme you'll see in [embed.bsky.app](https://embed.bsky.app/) and the default theme included in `bsky-react-post`.

## Usage

In any component, import `Post` from `bsky-react-post` and use it like so:

```tsx
import { Post } from "bsky-react-post";

export default function Page() {
  return <Post handle="adima7.bsky.social" id="3laq6uzwjbc2t" />;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Currently, `bsky-react-post` uses CSS Modules to scope the CSS of each component, so the bundler where it's used needs to support CSS Modules. If you get issues about your bundler not recognizing CSS Modules, please open an issue as we would like to know how well supported this is.
