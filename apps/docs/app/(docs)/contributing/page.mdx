# Contributing

To contribute, clone the [`bsky-react-post` repository](https://github.com/rhinobase/react-bluesky) and run the [Next.js test app](/next#running-the-test-app) to start an app locally that uses the [`bsky-react-post` package](https://github.com/rhinobase/react-bluesky/tree/main/packages/core). Any changes you make to the package will be reflected in the test app.

Once you're done making changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/rhinobase/react-bluesky/compare).

It's recommended to [open an issue](https://github.com/rhinobase/react-bluesky/issues/new) first before making any major changes to the package so that we can discuss the changes before you start working on them.
